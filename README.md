## Bookmarklet

Grab the latest bookmarklet from [here](https://bookmarkify.it/5554)

Drag the link from the site given above to your bookmarks bar to save this bookmarklet. If you don't see your bookmarks bar, try <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>. Once on the IMS Student Grade Details page, click the bookmarklet you just saved, and Voila!, a shiny new version of IMS appears (okay it's not as glorious as I make it sound, but atleast it's much more functional eh).

## What is it

A bookmarklet is a small script that runs straight from the bookmarks bar, when you click on it. This bookmarklet extends the functionality of the IIT Gandhinagar Institute Management System (IMS). 

**Disclaimer**: The grades you edit are only hypothetical, editing you grades won't change them in real life.

## What does it do

This bookmarklet, modifies the IIT Gandhinagar IMS "Student Grade Details" page, by adding a "Calculate CPI" button. It also allows you to edit your grades for you to analyze how much you would have scored under different scenarios. 

## Developer's Note

This is an independent project, and is not affiliated with the IMS or IIT Gandhinagar in any way.
